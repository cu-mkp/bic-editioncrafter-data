# Overview of TEI file 
- `<TEI>` = “root element,” contains entire doc
     - [`<teiHeader>`](#this-file-contains-teiheader-which-contains)
          - `<fileDesc>` = “file description,” bibliographic metadata
          - `<taxonomy>` (one or more) = project-define controlled vocabularies
     - [`<text>`](#then-a-text-element-that-contains-the-transcriptiontranslation-of-the-source)
          - `<div>` (one or more) = “division,” section of text
               - `<p>` (one or more) = “paragraph”
          - `<pb>` (one or more) = “page break,” wherever the document has a break
     - [`<facsimile>`](#then-facsimile-element-automatically-generated-by-faircopy-but-can-be-done-using-other-tools) = structures a set of images representing components of the source document
          - `<surface>` = one for each page/folio in the source document

# Detailed descriptions
See the M&K example file: [fr640_3r-3v-example.xml](https://github.com/cu-mkp/editioncrafter-data/blob/main/texts/fr640_3r-3v-example.xml)

## This file contains `<teiHeader>` which contains:
- Basic bibliographic metadata for the manuscript/document/text
- Taxonomies/controlled vocabularies providing project-specific terminology for enhanced semantics and subject-access (e.g., entry categories, phrase-level semantic tags)

## Then a `<text>` element that contains the transcription/translation of the source
- For the M&K example file, this has an id of `tl` to indicate that EditionCrafter should process this file as a translation
- The text is structured into divisions (`<div>`) containing paragraphs (`<p>`).
     - The paragraphs contain the text of the document (i.e., the translation) with some words/phrases tagged to provide further semantics e.g.,
          - To indicate that the word “stick” is a tool (or `<tl>`): 
          > `“flows from the tip of a <rs ref="#rs-tl">stick</rs> with which you grind it”` 
          
          - Where `#rs-tl` points to the id `rs-tl` of a term defined in the project-controlled vocabulary in a taxonomy earlier in the document: 
          > `<category n="tool" xml:id="rs-tl"><catDesc>tool, including any instrument, and physical or material object used to perform a process, including body parts and verbs such as "piler" (to pestle) that imply a tool.</catDesc>`
             
          - NOTE: “rs” is the name of the TEI element “referencing string” (contains a general purpose name or referring string) which might be appropriate for this usage, as would “seg” ((arbitrary segment) which represents any segmentation of text below the ‘chunk’ level). See [TEI Guidelines definition for `<p>`](https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-p.html).
          - TEI allows other "block-level" elements, e.g., `<ab>` or "anonymous block", lists, tables, quotations, verse lines, etc. See the [TEI Guidelines definition for `<div>`](https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-div.html).
- `<pb>` element (page beginning) with `facs` attribute
     - Points to id for the folio page used by both the `<facsimile>` element in the TEI file and the IIIF manifest 
     
## Then `<facsimile>` element (automatically generated by FairCopy, but can be done using other tools)
- Each `<surface>` element contains information and links for all facsimile images 
     - Has label for the corresponding image - the human-readable page or folio number (e.g., `<label>3r</label>`)
     - Contains graphic element linking to IIIF image
